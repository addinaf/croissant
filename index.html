        <p>A croissant or in Italian we usually called it cornetto or brioche, meaning "little horn". Cornetto is an
            Italian variation and it differs from a croissant in being softer and containing less butter.</p>
        <p>The cornetto vuoto (Italian: "empty cornetto") is commonly accompanied by various fillings, includings crema
            pasticceria (custard), apricot jam, or chocolate cream, and usually covered with powdered sugar or ground
            nuts. A cornetto with an espresso or a cappuccino at a coffee bar is considered to be the most common
            breakfast in Italy. The name cornetto is common in the Southern and Central part of Italy while it is called
            brioche in the Northern part.</p>
